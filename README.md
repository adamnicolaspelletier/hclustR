hclustR

Generate Heatmap after hierarchical clustering of gene expression. 

Measuring levels of similarity of their transcriptomic signature of distinct cell populations can be a useful tool in biology. 





Requirements:
  - made4 package 

  - expression data, ideally filtered based on personal criteria. a Heatmap based on whole transcriptome is long to process, hard to read, and difficult to draw conclusions from 

  




BUGS:
If you find a bug or have a suggestion please end your informations to adam.nicolas.pelletier@gmail.com
